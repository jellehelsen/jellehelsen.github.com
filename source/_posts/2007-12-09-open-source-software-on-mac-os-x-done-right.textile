category: Mac OS X

Installing open source software on Mac OS X can be a pain in the ass. Now there is an alternative to "Fink":http://www.finkproject.org/ or "MacPorts":http://www.macports.org/. The "Rudix":http://www.rudix.org/ project delivers open source software for Mac OS X in the Right Way. Everything is delivered as a standard Mac OS X installer package. Just double click to install. How cool is that?
