<p>The original ActiveRecordProxies have one very annoying problem. When you change a value on an object, the object is immediately saved to the database. This way you miss the best part about the Active Record pattern and it makes bindings unusable. When a user changes a value in the view, he should be able to save or reload. Saving the change immediately to the database would make that almost impossible.</p>

<p>At first I tried fixing ActiveRecordProxy myself, but that didn't work. So I decided to start from scratch. The result of can be downloaded <a href="http://www.hcode.be/downloads/hcode_activerecord_proxy.rb">here</a> </p>
<p>What's different from the normal ActiveRecordProxy class:
  <ul>
    <li>support for save and reload.</li>
    <li>minimal support for validations. If you use saveWithError, an NSError object is returned when saving fails. The userDict of this error should contain the validation errors.</li>
    <li><s>rails like setterMethods: you can now use <pre>CustomerProxy.name = "test"</pre> instead of <pre>CustomerProxy.setValue_forKey("test", :name)</pre></s>
(Updated: this already seems to work on normal ActiveRecordProxy objects)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

To use it, put it in your load path and use it as your proxy superclass. If you're using rucola, I will post a plugin in a couple of days. If you're not using it yet, you should <a href="http://rucola.rubyforge.org/">check it out</a>.
