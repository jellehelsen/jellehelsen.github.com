title: Printing booklets with pdfjam
---
Recently I wanted to create a booklet from a pdf I created with "XeLaTex":http://scripts.sil.org/xetex . I found out that "MacTex":http://www.tug.org/mactex/ comes with a tool for that. Pdfjam and it's front-end pdfbook are the perfect tools for the job.

{% highlight bash %}
pdfbook --short-edge file.pdf
{% endhighlight %}

This creates a file name file-book.pdf. This file is ready for duplex printing and folding into a booklet afterwards.
