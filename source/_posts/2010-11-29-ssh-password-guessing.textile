This weekend I caught a bot trying to get into my server using ssh.<!--more--> This was what I saw in my log file:

These are just some snippets from the log (/var/log/secure.log).
If one of these IP addresses is you then get those trojans of your computer.

h3. Counter measures

Thanks to well chosen passwords, none of my accounts seemed to be compromised. Nevertheless I disabled password login for ssh. This is how it's done:
# Make sure public key authentication works. If it doesn't you will lock yourself out when disabling password authentication.
# Open /etc/sshd_config with your favorite editor.
# Uncomment the line where it says "PasswordAuthentication no"
# Disable ssh's PAM support by uncommenting the line "UsePAM no"
# Restart sshd

Now ssh now longer accepts password authentication and hackers can try to guess passwords as long as they want.

NB: Since disabling password authentication the attacks continue. At least I'm confident there are no passwords to be guessed. I'm still searching for a way to dynamicly block these ip addresses with the firewall.
