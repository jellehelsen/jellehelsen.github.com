My name is Jelle Helsen. I'm a self employed developer and support consultant. I've spent the last 12 years doing support on the Macintosh platform. I've seen every version of Mac OS, starting with System 7 and all the way up to Mac OS X 10.6 Server. On the side I also do development work. Lately this has been concentrating around Ruby On Rails.
